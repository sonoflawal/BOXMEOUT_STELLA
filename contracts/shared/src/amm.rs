/// Computes the maximum collateral a buyer can spend (or shares a seller can sell)
/// without draining the target reserve to zero.
///
/// Used as a guard in buy_shares and sell_shares to prevent reserve depletion.
///
/// # Arguments
/// * `reserve` - Current reserve balance in stroops
/// * `balance` - Current balance of the opposite side in stroops
///
/// # Returns
/// The largest collateral_in such that target_reserve_after >= 1
///
/// # Formula
/// Using constant product AMM: reserve * balance = k (constant)
/// After trade: (reserve - collateral_in) * (balance + shares_out) = k
/// Solving for max collateral_in where reserve_after = 1:
/// (1) * (balance + shares_out) = reserve * balance
/// shares_out = reserve * balance - balance
/// collateral_in = reserve - 1

/// # Arguments
/// * `lp_fee_per_share` - Current accumulated fee per share
